# EDA on Car Dataset

This project provides a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Car dataset. The analysis focuses on uncovering relationships, patterns, and insights between various attributes such as price, brand, year, fuel type, mileage, and horsepower. The objective is to understand the dataset comprehensively and prepare it for further applications such as regression or classification modeling.

## File Included
- **EDA on Car Dataset.ipynb** â€” a Jupyter notebook containing all analysis steps, data exploration, and visualizations.

## Dataset Overview
- **File:** car.csv  
- **Description:** Contains detailed information on different cars including company, model, year of manufacture, fuel type, mileage, and price.  
The dataset combines both categorical and numerical variables suitable for data profiling and visualization.

## Structure of the EDA

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Handling missing values  
- Removing duplicate records  
- Converting data types for consistency  

### 2. Univariate Analysis
- Distribution plots for numerical attributes  
- Count plots for categorical variables  
- Examination of frequency distributions  

### 3. Bivariate Analysis
- Studying the relationship between price and other features  
- Visualizing dependencies with scatter and box plots  
- Correlation heatmap for numerical attributes  

### 4. Outlier Detection
- Identifying unusual data points affecting key features  
- Visualization-based validation using box plots  

## Techniques and Tools
- **Python** for implementation  
- **pandas**, **numpy** for data handling and computation  
- **matplotlib**, **seaborn** for data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for exploratory workflow and analysis  

## Key Findings
- Price trends vary significantly with brand, model year, and fuel type.  
- Mileage and horsepower show strong influence on price distribution.  
- Certain categorical features have clear separation patterns, aiding predictive modeling.  
- The dataset is largely clean after preprocessing, suitable for further modeling or feature engineering.
